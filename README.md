Antivirus software that checks for the presence of a specific malware signature
Building a full-fledged antivirus software involves complex algorithms, deep knowledge of system internals, and significant development effort. Additionally, implementing a robust antivirus requires constant updates and improvements to keep up with evolving malware threats. While it's not feasible to create a comprehensive antivirus from scratch in a short code snippet, I have written a basic example of how you might approach building a simple file scanner in C language.

Below is a very basic example of a file scanner in C that checks for the presence of a specific malware signature (for demonstration purposes only). This example scans a file named "file_to_scan.txt" and checks if it contains the string "malware_signature". If you need a full fledged antivirus please contact me via raphaelosanmi@gmail.com, so we can talk about your project.
